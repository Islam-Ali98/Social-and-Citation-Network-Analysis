# Social-and-Citation-Network-Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of three types of networks: Facebook (undirected), Twitter (directed), and a scientific citation network (Cora dataset). Each network represents a different type of relationship, and the objective is to analyze their properties with respect to user connections, followers, and citations.

## Project Overview

### Facebook Network (Undirected Graph):

The Facebook network is modeled as an undirected graph, where edges represent friendships between users.
Goal: Calculate which users have the most friends (highest degree).
Analysis: Degree centrality is used to determine the most connected users (friends).

### Twitter Network (Directed Graph):

The Twitter network is modeled as a directed graph, where edges represent followers and followees.
Goal: Identify users with the most followers (highest in-degree).
Analysis: In-degree centrality is used to find the most influential users.
Scientific Citation Network (Cora Dataset, Directed Graph):

## The citation network

The citation network is modeled as a directed graph, where edges represent citations between scientific papers.
Goal: Determine which paper has the most citations (highest in-degree).
Analysis: In-degree centrality is used to find the most cited papers.
